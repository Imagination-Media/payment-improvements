# Payment Request API integration

This is clone of Magento 2 Open Source for integration with [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show-method).

**Goal:** Integration with [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#show-method).

**Agile Board:** [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/magento/payment-improvements/boards?milestones=Payment%20Request%20API%20Prototype%23), [Milestone](https://github.com/magento/payment-improvements/milestone/1)

**Slack:** [#payments-improvements](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C8MSFSK1N) (use this [sign up link](https://tinyurl.com/engcom-signup) if not registered yet)

**Release strategy:** Payment Request API is developed in `payment-request-api` branch. All code contributed to `Magento_PaymentRequestApi` will be released after integration complete. Release strategy would be defined later (possible option is merge to the Magento core or release as independent module). All contribution outside from `Magento_PaymentRequestApi` will be delivered to current Magento 2 Open Source development branch (`2.3-develop` now). 

**Documentation:** All documentation artifacts to this project should be added as [wiki pages at GitHub](https://github.com/magento/payment-improvements/wiki)
